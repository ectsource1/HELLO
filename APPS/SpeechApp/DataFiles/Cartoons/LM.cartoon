Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him.

Annoyed by the little Mouse's disturbance, the Lion suddenly woke up. He grabbed the Mouse with his huge paw and opened his huge jaws ready to swallow the Mouse whole.

"O great king. Please, spare me!" cried the little Mouse. 
I won't do it again. I promise! If you let me go, one of these days, I may be able to repay your kindness.

The Lion found the little Mouse's response to be quite amusing and decided to let the Mouse live for another day. 
He quickly lifted his paw and allow the Mouse to be on his way.

Later on, a few hunters used a trapped net to capture the Lion. 
In order to transport the Lion, the hunters went out to search for a wagon leaving the Lion tied to a tree.
